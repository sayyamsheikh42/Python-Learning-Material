# Advanced Functions & Patterns

## Learning Objectives
- Higher-order functions & closures
- Function decorators
- Iterators & generators in depth
- Context managers (__enter__, __exit__)
- Best-practice patterns

## What You'll Build
- Short runnable examples in `examples.py`
- Visuals in `visuals.py` (matplotlib)

## Exercises
- See `exercises/` for prompts
- Check `solutions/` after you try

## How to Run
```bash
python examples.py
python visuals.py
```
