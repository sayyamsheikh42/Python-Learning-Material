# Data Types & Immutability

## Learning Objectives
- Numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, dicts
- Mutability vs immutability
- Boolean evaluation & truthiness
- Identity (is) vs equality (==)
- isinstance checks

## What You'll Build
- Short runnable examples in `examples.py`
- Visuals in `visuals.py` (matplotlib)

## Exercises
- See `exercises/` for prompts
- Check `solutions/` after you try

## How to Run
```bash
python examples.py
python visuals.py
```
